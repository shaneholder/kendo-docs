# kendo.ui.Upload

## Description



An **Upload** uses progressive enhancement to deliver the best possible uploading experience to
users without requiring extra developer effort. Features highlights:


*   Asynchronous and synchronous (on form submit) file upload
*   Multiple file selection
*   Removing uploaded files
*   Progress tracking *
*   File drag-and-drop *
*   Cancelling upload in-progress *


(*) These features are automatically enabled if supported by the browser.

An **Upload** is a standards-based widget; no plug-ins required.

### Getting Started

#### 1\. Create a simple HTML form and input element of type "file"

    <!-- Kendo will automatically set the form enctype attribute to "multi-part/form-data" -->
    <form method="post" action="handler.php">
        <div>
            <input name="photos[]" id="photos" type="file" />
        </div>
    </form>

#### 2\. Initialize Upload with a jQuery selector

    $(document).ready(function() {
        $("#photos").kendoUpload();
    });

Note the array syntax in the input name; it is used to hint the upload handler to treat photos as an array.



Please consult the documentation of your specific server technology regarding the handling of uploaded files.

### Accessing an Existing Upload


You can reference an existing **Upload** instance via
[jQuery.data()](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/). Once a reference has been established, you can
use the API to control its behavior.

#### Accessing an existing Upload instance

    var upload = $("#upload").data("kendoUpload");

## Configuration

### async `Object`

Configures the ability to upload a file(s) in an asynchronous manner. Please refer to the
[async mode help topic](http://www.kendoui.com/documentation/ui-widgets/upload/modes.aspx#async)
for more details.

### async.autoUpload `Boolean`*(default: true)*

The selected files will be uploaded immediately by default. You can change this behavior by setting
autoUpload to false.

### async.batch `Boolean`*(default: false)*

The selected files will be uploaded in separate requests by default. You can change this behavior by setting
batch to true.

### async.removeField `String`*(default: "fileNames")*

The name of the form field submitted to the Remove URL.

### async.removeUrl `String`

The URL of the handler responsible for removing uploaded files (if any). The handler must accept POST
requests containing one or more "fileNames" fields specifying the files to be deleted.

### async.removeVerb `String`*(default: "DELETE")*

The HTTP verb to be used by the remove action.

### async.saveField `String`

The name of the form field submitted to the save URL. The default value is the input name.

### async.saveUrl `String`

The URL of the handler that will receive the submitted files. The handler must accept POST requests
containing one or more fields with the same name as the original input name.

### enabled `Boolean`*(default: true)*

Enables (**true**) or disables (**false**) an **Upload**. A disabled
**Upload** may be re-enabled via enable().

### localization `Object`

Sets the strings rendered by the Upload.

### localization.cancel `String`

Sets the text of the cancel button text.

### localization.dropFilesHere `String`*(default: "drop files here to upload")*

Sets the drop zone hint.

### localization.remove `String`

Sets the text of the remove button text.

### localization.retry `String`

Sets the text of the retry button text.

### localization.select `String`

Sets the "Select..." button text.

### localization.statusFailed `String`

Sets the status message for failed uploads.

### localization.statusUploaded `String`

Sets the status message for uploaded files.

### localization.statusUploading `String`

Sets the status message for files that are being uploaded.

### localization.uploadSelectedFiles `String`

Sets the text of the "Upload files" button.

### multiple `Boolean`*(default: true)*

Enables (**true**) or disables (**false**) the ability to select multiple files.
If **false**, users will be able to select only one file at a time. Note: This option does not
limit the total number of uploaded files in an asynchronous configuration.

### showFileList `Boolean`*(default: true)*

Enables (**true**) or disables (**false**) the ability to display a file listing
for uploading a file(s). Disabling a file listing may be useful you wish to customize the UI; use the
client-side events to build your own UI.
